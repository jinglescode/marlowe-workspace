notes:
- how many contracts are on playground
- how many use "open roles"
- how kind of contracts user use more, so we know where to focus
- marlowe runtime use postgre DB, use that as data source
- can make dandagrams, define the distance
- how many or what this and there are there
- do clustering
- flat the JSON into vector, and check vector space
- payment address are wallets, so how many actual users? minus those run stress test and created multiple wallets
- can run marlowe local copy using docker
- can get snapshots
- run the playground contracts
- how many contracts of different kinds
- 


business questions:
- help people understand what is going on
- know how marlowe is being used
- what use cases are popular. there are different type of contracts, are people using for tokens or swaps or what kind of "clusters". that might affect our focus
- separate testing vs actual use
- there are transaction limit, how many contracts/transactions are hitting the limit, from dbsync, we can see these cost, how close transactions are close to the limit
- are we attacting new users, are old users sticking around
